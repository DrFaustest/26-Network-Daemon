ABOUT.TXT for Network Device Identifier Program

Program Description:
This program is a network device identifier tool designed to scan a network, identify devices by their IP and MAC addresses, and retrieve the manufacturer information of each device. It operates by executing a network scan, logging results, and interacting with an external API for manufacturer details.

Key Features:
1. Network Scanning: Uses the 'arp' command to find active devices on the network, extracting their IP and MAC addresses.
2. Manufacturer Identification: Fetches the manufacturer's name of a device using its MAC address through an external API.
3. Logging System: Maintains three types of logs - error logs, runtime logs, and JSON data logs for tracking various events and data.
4. Data Storage: Stores the IP address, MAC address, and manufacturer information in a CSV file for future reference.

Modules and Libraries Used:
1. subprocess - To execute system commands for network scanning.
2. re - Regular expression operations for parsing command output.
3. requests - For making HTTP requests to the external API.
4. csv - For writing data to a CSV file.
5. datetime - For timestamping log entries.

Functions:
1. log_error(message): Logs error messages with timestamps.
2. log_run(message): Logs runtime events.
3. log_json(data): Logs JSON data received from the API.
4. ping_network(): Scans the network and returns IP-MAC pairs.
5. get_device_manufacturer(mac_address): Retrieves the manufacturer's name using the MAC address.
6. store_data(ip_address, mac_address, manufacturer): Stores data in a CSV file.

Usage:
- Execute the program to scan the network.
- Check 'storage.csv' for the list of devices and their manufacturers.
- Review 'errorLog.txt', 'runLog.txt', and 'jsonLog.txt' for logs.

Note:
- Ensure you have internet connectivity for the API calls.
- Run the program with appropriate permissions for network scanning.
- API limits and network configurations may affect the program's functionality.
